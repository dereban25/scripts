Sure! Here's an example of a README.md file that explains how to run the script with parameters:

```
# Resource Usage Script

This script retrieves resource usage statistics from Kubernetes for a specified resource type in a given namespace.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed:
   - Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`)
   - Bash shell

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Run the script with the following command:
   ```
   bash kubeplugin.sh <command> <resource_type> <namespace> 
   ```

   Replace `<namespace>` with the target namespace in Kubernetes.
   Replace `<resource_type>` with the desired resource type (e.g., `pods`, `deployments`, etc.).

4. The script will retrieve the resource usage statistics for the specified resource type in the given namespace and display them on the console.

   Example output:
   ```
   Resource: pods, Namespace: my-namespace, Name: my-pod-1, CPU: 100m, Memory: 256Mi
   Resource: pods, Namespace: my-namespace, Name: my-pod-2, CPU: 200m, Memory: 512Mi
   ...
   ```

## Examples

- Retrieve CPU and memory usage statistics for all pods in the `default` namespace:
  ```
  bash resource-usage.sh default get pods
  ```

- Describe the resource usage for all deployments in the `my-app` namespace:
  ```
  bash resource-usage.sh my-app describe deployments
  ```

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the Kubernetes cluster and retrieve resource usage statistics.
- Adjust the `kubectl` command in the script if you need to customize the output or retrieve additional information.
- Modify the script as needed to suit your specific requirements and environment.
```

Feel free to modify the content and instructions based on your script and specific use case.
